# friendlist-fix
Fixes the years old friendlist crash/freeze bug on patch v100

# Known issues
Friendlist UI won't update if someone logs in/out while the UI is open until you re-open it

The client might freeze for a few seconds if the friendlist wasn't opened for a very long time while having a large amount of friends
