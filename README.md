# friendlist-fix
Fixes the years old friendlist crash/freeze bug on patch v100

# IMPORTANT
DO NOT move the def files - it will install automatically

Remove any other fix laggy friends list modules or this may not work as intended

# Known issues
Friendlist UI won't update if someone logs in/out while the UI is open until you re-open it

The client might freeze for a few seconds if the friendlist wasn't opened for a very long time while having a large amount of friends
